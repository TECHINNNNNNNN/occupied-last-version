# Chulalongkorn Engineering Library Occupancy System

## Project Overview

The Chulalongkorn Engineering Library Occupancy System is a web-based platform designed to help students and faculty monitor, analyze, and manage library space utilization in real-time. The system provides users with up-to-date information on library occupancy levels, allows for room reservations, facilitates student communication, and offers analytical insights into usage patterns.

The interface features a clean, modern design that prioritizes usability and functionality.

### Vision

To create a comprehensive digital solution that optimizes library space utilization, enhances the student experience, and provides valuable data insights for library management, ultimately fostering a more productive and collaborative academic environment.

### Business Objectives

- Increase library resource utilization efficiency by 30% within the first year
- Reduce wait times for study spaces and resources by 40%
- Improve student satisfaction with library services by 25%
- Generate actionable insights for library management to optimize space allocation
- Create a digital platform that can be expanded to other university facilities
